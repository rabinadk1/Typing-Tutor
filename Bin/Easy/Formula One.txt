The formula one series originated with the
European grand prix motor racing of the 1920s and
1930s. The formula is a set of rules that all
participants' cars must meet.

Formula one was a new formula agreed after World
War II during 1946, with the first non
championship races being held that year.

A number of grand prix racing organizations had
laid out rules for a world championship before
war, but due to the suspension of racing during
the conflict, the world drivers' championship was
not formalized until 1947. The first world
championship race was held at Silverstone, United
Kingdom during 1950.
