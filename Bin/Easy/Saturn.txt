Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun in the
solar system. It is the second largest planet in
the solar system, after Jupiter. Like Jupiter,
Uranus and Neptune, it is a gas giant.

The inside of Saturn is probably a core of iron,
nickel, silicon and oxygen compounds, surrounded
by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, then a layer
of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium and finally,
an outer gaseous layer.

Saturn has 62 known moons orbiting the planet;
53 are officially named. The largest moon is
Titan, which is larger in volume than the planet
Mercury. Titan is the second largest moon in the
solar system.
