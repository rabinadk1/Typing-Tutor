Tihar, also known as Deepawali and Yamapanchak or Swanti 
is a five-day-long Hindu festival celebrated in Nepal and
 in the Indian states of Assam and Sikkim including in 
Darjeeling district of West Bengal. It is the festival
 of lights, as diyas are lit inside and outside the houses
 to make it illuminate at night. It is popularly known as 
Swanti among the Newars and as Deepawali among Madhesis.
Set in the Vikram Samvat calendar, the festival begins with
 Kaag Tihar in Trayodashi of Kartik Krishna Paksha and ends
 with Bhai Tika in Dwitiya of Kartik Sukla Paksha every year.

Tihar is the second biggest Nepalese festival after Dashain.
 It is considered to be of great importance as it shows reverence
 to not just the humans and the gods, but also to the animals like 
crows, cows, and dogs that maintain an intimate relationship with
 humans. People make patterns on the floor of living rooms or 
courtyards using materials such as colored rice, dry flour, 
colored sand or flower petals outside their house, called Rangoli,
 which is meant to be a sacred welcoming area for the Gods and 
Goddesses of Hinduism mainly Goddess Laxmi.

Crows and ravens are worshiped by offerings of sweets and
dishes placed on the roofs of houses. The cawing of crows
 and ravens symbolizes sadness and grief in Hinduism, so 
devotees offer crows and ravens food to avert grief and 
death in their homes. Tihar represents the divine attachment
 between humans and other animals.
