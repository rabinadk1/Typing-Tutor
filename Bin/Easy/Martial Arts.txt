Choosing the right martial arts training for you
can be extremely confusing and a little
overwhelming given the huge number of options
available.

In simple terms, the vast majority of styles fall
into one of three types. Namely, traditional
styles such as Karate or Judo, combat sports
styles like MMA or kickboxing, or the self defense
styles of Krav Maga or reality based self defense.

Each has its pros and cons, but there should be
considerable overlap across these styles as there
are a lot of common skills and after all the name
martial arts does suggest some competency in the
ability to defend oneself if attacked.
