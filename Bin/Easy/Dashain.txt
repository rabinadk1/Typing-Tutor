During the month of Kartik (late September and early October),
the Nepalese people indulge in the biggest festival of the year,
Dashain. Dashain is the longest and the most auspicious festival
in the Nepalese annual calendar, celebrated by Nepalese of all 
caste and creed throughout the country. The fifteen days of 
celebration occurs during the bright lunar fortnight ending on 
the day of the full moon. Thorough out the kingdom of Nepal the
goddess Durga in all her manifestations are worshiped with
innumerable pujas, abundant offerings and thousands of animal
sacrifices for the ritual holy bathing, thus drenching the 
goddess for days in blood.
