The 1910 Cuba hurricane was said to be one of
the worst tropical cyclones that has ever hit
Cuba. The storm formed in the southern caribbean
sea on October 9, 1910.

It grew stronger as it moved northwest. It then
made landfall on the western end of Cuba. The
storm made a loop over open water and then began
moving toward the United States.

After crossing Florida, the storm moved near the
rest of the southeastern United States and passed
out to sea. Because of the storm's loop, some
reports said it was actually two hurricanes. In
Cuba, the storm was one of the worst disasters in
the island's history.
